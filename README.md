# AI-Virtual-Mouse

This project aims to provide users with an intuitive way to control their computer's mouse cursor using hand gestures captured through a camera feed. By leveraging computer vision techniques, OpenCV, and MediaPipe from Google, this application detects and tracks the user's hand movements in real-time, translating them into corresponding mouse actions such as movement, clicking, and scrolling.
